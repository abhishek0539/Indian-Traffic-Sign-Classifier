# Indian Traffic Sign Language Recognition Flask Application

This project is a **Flask web application** for recognizing Indian Traffic Sign Language  using deep learning. The application leverages a trained neural network model which is based on InceptionV3 to classify Traffic sign from images.

## About Dataset
The Indian Traffic Signs Prediction (85 Classes) dataset includes a variety of real-world photos of 85 different types of traffic signs that were taken in different settings.

**Dataset summary**
- The dataset has two main directories: `train/` and `test/`.
- Each directory contains subfolders for 85 traffic sign classes.
- Subfolder names represent the traffic sign category.
- Each subfolder contains multiple images of that specific traffic sign.
- Images vary in resolution, lighting, and background to reflect real-world conditions.

## Model Architecture
**InceptionV3** is designed with factorized convolutions and auxiliary classifiers, making it both computationally efficient and highly effective for multi-class image classification. In traffic sign recognition tasks, it has demonstrated strong performance, achieving high accuracy and robust generalization to real-world images
